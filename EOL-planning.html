<h1>End-of-life (EOL) planning</h1>

<p>For a chronically ill pet, I recommend making an end-of-life plan as the end nears, even if your pet is not quite yet in a terminal stage of their disease. End of life decisions can potentially involve enormous amounts of money and can be incredibly stressful and overwhelming.
</p>

<p>You can always change your exact decisions when the time comes, but it removes a huge emotional load if you know what to expect *before* you're sobbing uncontrollably into a towel and being asked to sign hospital forms and pay bills.
</p>

<p>I sobbed a lot while researching this information, so I hope that collecting it all into one place can make things a little bit easier for someone else out there.
</p>

<h2>Preparing yourself</h2>

<p>No matter what decisions you make, it is good to have at least one person on call, who is willing to be with you and drive you to the hospital for the difficult parts. 
</p>

<p>Tanya's Guide has a very well written <a href="http://felinecrf.org/the_final_hours.htm">end-of-life page</a>. If you are able to stomach it, I think this page does a very good job helping you understand what to expect, both logistically and emotionally.
</p>

<p>I have commonly heard from dogs' humans that "they just knew when it was time", but reports from cats' humans appear to be mixed. I speculate that this may be related to differences in inappetence between cats and dogs; cats can lose their appetite for a variety of medical reasons that have nothing to do with their desire to live.
</p>

<p>One helpful piece of advice I got was to have a conversation with your pet when you are ready to let go. Although they may not understand all your words, they understand your body language, and saying the words can help you express your body language.
</p>

<p>Things were hard with Reese because he had so many ups and downs and there was never a time where it seemed like he was "ready", even when he was extremely weakened and things were very difficult for him. It was clear that he loved being with me and that would never change, but he passed a few days after I told him that I was ready to let go if it was too hard for him to keep staying alive for me.
</p>

<h2>Expensive decisions</h2>

<p>If you are reading this page well in advance of the end, it will definitely go much easier if you are able to build up or crowdfund at least $2000-3000 in your pet emergency fund, though I know that is a luxury many people cannot afford. Depending where you live, it could cost several hundred dollars just for home euthanasia and cremation. 
</p>

<p>I hope this page will at least help you figure out what services you are able to afford so you can emotionally prepare for these difficult decisions.
</p>

<h3>Getting help with EOL planning</h3>

<p>An unhurried end-of-life consultation is really worth it. My consult helped me make better medical decisions, which probably saved me a lot of money in desperate end-of-life hospital bills that wouldn't have helped Reese anyway. Many vets, especially ER vets, are under extremely high pressure with their critical patients and don't have time to walk you through these difficult decision-making processes.
</p>

<p><a href="https://pethospice.bluepearlvet.com/services/virtual-quality-of-life-consultation/">Blue Pearl hospice care</a> offers virtual quality-of-life consultations, ranging from 
$95-195. They can help you understand your remaining medical options, how to make the hard decisions, and EOL planning.</p>

<p>It is also possible to find pet "death doulas", who can help you with EOL planning and emotional aftercare. Think of them as a buddy who can help you through the process if you don't have friends you feel comfortable asking to help. Their services tend to be less inexpensive since they are not veterinarians. Here is one pet death doula's <a href="https://petdeathdoula.com/resources">resource page</a>.</p>

<p>It lightened my burden a great deal to get expert help making a plan for Reese, learn about his remaining options, and know that I was really doing the best I possibly could for him.</p>

<h3>Do Not Resuscitate?</h3>

<p>If your pet's heart unexpectedly stops at the hospital, resuscitation and life support can cost a few hundred to two thousand dollars. You will be asked to pre-approve your preference as soon as you drop them off at the hospital so they can act ASAP. (I did not realize they would ask me to make this decision on the spot and subsequently had a breakdown in the parking lot.)</p>

<p>The ERs I went to toward the end of Reese's life all strongly recommended I check Do Not Resuscitate for him. They said that CPR can be traumatic and has a very low success probability for a cat who is already in very bad health, and that I would only be slightly prolonging the inevitable.</p>

<p>Even though I was resolved to be with him in his last moments if at all possible, I accepted DNR near the end when he was extremely frail.</p>

<h3>Euthanasia</h3>

<p>There is extremely wide cost variance in end-of-life services, depending on the cost of living in your area. Here are the costs I found in the U.S.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Home euthanasia: $200-450</li>
  <li>Hospital euthanasia: $50-200</li>
</ul>

<p>Vets may push strongly for euthanasia toward the end because it is very hard to predict how prolonged or painful a natural death will be.</p>

<h3>Immediate aftermath</h3>

<p>If you want, the vet can give you privacy to hold the body and grieve for a while. It is ok to be a complete mess during all of this.</p>

<p>I howled and screamed at the top of my lungs for over half an hour until the body began to grow cold and then I went home and sobbed some more. It was absolutely awful, but also necessary and cathartic for me. I do feel like holding the body helped me come to terms with the fact that he was truly gone and there was nothing more I could do for him. A dead body feels unmistakably different than a sleeping living being.</p>

<h3>What happens to the body</h3>

<p>If they pass away at home, you can either take their body to a nearby pet hospital or contact a pet hospice care for body pickup service (which may be expensive). You may also choose to bury the body yourself if you have a place to do it.</p>

<h3>Cremation</h3>

<p>Cremation services can be arranged for at a pet hospital or via pet hospice care.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communal cremation: $30-150. The body will be cremated with other bodies, and the ashes scattered in a peaceful location which you may visit.</li>
  <li>Individual cremation: $100-250. The body will be cremated within a partition, in a crematory shared with other bodies. There is a chance that some of the cremains may mix, but they will mostly stay separate. The ashes are returned to you.</li>
  <li>Private cremation: $175-400. The body will be cremated entirely on its own in the crematory. The ashes are returned to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Costs are generally the same for all pets under 20 lbs. If you have a larger animal such as a dog, cremation costs will vary by size. Some pet crematories may not be able to manage bodies over 100 lbs, or may charge a very high cost, so try to find this out so you're not surprised when the time comes.</p>

<p>Thoughts: I personally chose communal cremation since it is not important to me to hold onto part of the dead body, but everyone may have different reasons & preferences.</p>

<h2>Paw print</h2>

<p>Pet hospitals and EOL services usually offer an ink paw print and/or a 3d clay paw impression when your pet has passed.</p>

<p>Thoughts: If you want a paw impression, I would strongly recommend DIYing one while they are still alive -- the paw print will be associated with a better memory for you that way. I do have an ink print from the hospital that I kind of hate because I know it was made from his stiff dead paw.</p>

<p>I made a mold from Reese's paw while he was still alive, and made a rubber casting from it that has been helpful to hold whenever I miss him (which is basically all the time).</p>

<h3>DIY paw casting</h3>

<p>Use a nontoxic substance, ideally one that will set very quickly so your pet doesn't get too impatient. Some common options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Salt dough ($0-5) - low-resolution, but doable with common pantry supplies</li>
  <li>Air-dry clay ($10)</li>
  <li>Two-part food-safe molding putty ($25) - high-resolution, good if you want to make multiple casts</li>
</ul>
